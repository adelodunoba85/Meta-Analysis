# Advanced Meta-Analysis in Python
## Overview

This repository implements a full meta-analysis pipeline in Python for clinical and epidemiological research.

## The project demonstrates:

Fixed-effects model

Random-effects model (DerSimonian–Laird)

Heterogeneity statistics (Q, I², τ²)

Subgroup analysis

Meta-regression

Publication bias assessment (Funnel plot, Egger’s test)

Forest plot visualization

## Statistical Framework

Random-effects estimation follows the
Rebecca DerSimonian –
Nan Laird method (1986).

## Applications

Clinical trials

Epidemiological studies

AI model performance pooling

Systematic reviews and evidence synthesis

## Key Outputs

Pooled effect size estimates

95% confidence intervals

Between-study variance (τ²)

Heterogeneity statistics (Q, I²)

Forest and funnel plots
